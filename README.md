# Pong

My implementation of the classic game, Pong.

Bricks are placed into the middle of the UI, and a number of balls appear on the screen. Moving the paddles on the edges of the screen, the user can hit the balls towards the bricks to try to clear all the bricks out of the middle of the screen.
